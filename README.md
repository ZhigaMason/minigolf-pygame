# Topic of your semestral work
I would like to make the minigolf game for one or several players. A game will be 2D and will use pyGame framework. Levels will be viewed isometrically (from the top). When striking a ball, an arrow will appear indicating strength of hit. Several levels will be explaining game mechanics (such as bouncing and silent walls, slippery floors and other level-design elements that will affect gameplay) and several more with real challenge.  Total number of levels will be at least 12.

Describe a function of developed application, necessary dependencies (e.g. utilize requirements.txt), how to start it, and last but not least how to run tests from CLI.
